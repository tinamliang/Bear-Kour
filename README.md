A cute, lighthearted platform game originally inspired by the infamous Fireboy and Watergirl that's built using the javascript framework - phaser.js. Connected to a firebase database that displays a real-time leaderboard.

## Credits

Huge credits go to **ourcade's** youtube channel. 

* Specifically their [pong tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo40OaolRs8&list=PLumYWZ2t7CRvdJJ206QarbisxYPAyYwj0) that taught me how to create a phaser game with multiple scenes.
